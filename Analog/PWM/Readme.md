## Generating a PWM output from stm32
- PWM stands for pulse width modulation and is used for controlling the amplitude of digital signals in order to control devices and applications requiring power or electricity.
- I have written a program to generate PWM output at TIM12's channel 1 to dim the on-board LED connected to the same pin(PB14).
- PWM works by using TIMERS present in the microcontroller.
